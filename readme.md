# Modeling Humanitarian Logistics

Phase I of a model simulating logistics of refugee intake and housing as well as the mental health of those involved.
An agent based simulation in the tradition of Schilling / Gilbert. Phase I models only the legal transitions through various states of an externally displaced person, asylum seeker, and temporary resident. 

Phase II will include the logistics of AZC construction. That is, during times of large influx of refugees, how does government with its limited means provide housing.

Phase III will add a mental health characterization to refugee agents.

### Notes
To control the rate by which newcomers are added to the simulation use the slider. Changes do not take effect until the simulation has been stopped and restarted, however.
